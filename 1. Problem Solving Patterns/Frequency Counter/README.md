PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERN: FREQUENCY COUNTER

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect frequencies of values.

Why use a frequency counter pattern ?

The frequency counter pattern is best applied to situations where we are comparing data and are interested the frequency of occurance. Use cases can be:
* Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.
* Given two strings, determine if the second string is an anagram of the first.
* Determine if there are duplicates in a set of data.

The advantage is that it will usually have big O of O(n) time complexity compared to other approaches, such as a nested loop solution, that will have big O of O(nÂ²).
